# Mappedin With Indoor Atlas

This project demonstrates the integration of [Indoor Atlas Android SDK](https://www.indooratlas.com/get-started/) with the [Mappedin Android SDK](https://developer.mappedin.com/android-sdk/latest/getting-started). Location information is provided by the Indoor Atlas indoor location system and passed to the Mappedin Android SDK.
