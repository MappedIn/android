# Mappedin With Oriient

This project demonstrates the integration of [Oriient SDK](https://www.oriient.me/) with the [Mappedin Android SDK](https://developer.mappedin.com/android-sdk/latest/getting-started). Location information is provided by the Oriient indoor location system and passed to the Mappedin Android SDK.

This project is featured in the blog post: [Indoor Orientation with Oriient and Mappedin](https://www.mappedin.com/blog/developers/use-cases/indoor-orientation-with-oriient-and-mappedin/)

To view actual location updates run this sample on a real Android device in a location that has both an Mappedin Map and Oriient location position system.
