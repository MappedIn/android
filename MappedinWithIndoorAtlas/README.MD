# Mappedin With Indoor Atlas

This project demonstrates the integration of [Indoor Atlas Android SDK](https://www.indooratlas.com/get-started/) with the [Mappedin Android SDK](https://developer.mappedin.com/android-sdk/latest/getting-started). Location information is provided by the Indoor Atlas indoor location system and passed to the Mappedin Android SDK. 

To view actual location updates run this sample on a real Android device in a location that has both an Mappedin Map and Indoor Atlas location position system.

- Modify `MainActivity.java` to enter your Mappedin ClientId, ClientSecret and Venue.
