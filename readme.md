# Mappedin Android Samples

This repo contains sample applications demonstrating different ways to integrate with the Mappedin SDK for Android to render maps and build a custom indoor mapping experience. To learn more about ways to integrate with Mappedin, refer to [developer.mappedin.com](https://developer.mappedin.com/).

The Mappedin SDK for Android enables you to build powerful and highly flexible indoor mapping experiences natively on Android.

This repo also contains a project demonstrating how to use an Android WebView to integrate with our out of the box web product, [Mappedin Web](https://www.mappedin.com/wayfinding/web-app/).
