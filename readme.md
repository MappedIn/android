# Mappedin Android Samples

This repo contains sample applications demonstrating different ways to integrate with the Mappedin SDK for Android to render maps and build a custom indoor mapping experience. To learn more about ways to integrate with Mappedin, refer to [developer.mappedin.com](https://developer.mappedin.com/).

The Mappedin SDK for Android enables you to build powerful and highly flexible indoor mapping experiences natively on Android.

This repo also contains a project demonstrating how to use an Android WebView to integrate with our out of the box web product, [Mappedin Web](https://www.mappedin.com/wayfinding/web-app/).

## Mappedin Android SDK Examples

To read more about the Mappedin SDK for Android, refer to [Getting Started with Mappedin SDK for Android](https://developer.mappedin.com/android-sdk/getting-started) and additional guides in the Mappedin developer docs.

The sample projects in this repo provide a client Id and client secret to access demo venues. Production apps will need their own unique client ID and client secret. Contact your Mappedin representative in order to obtain identifiers for your venues.

The following table list the sample applications that pertain to the latest version of the Mappedin SDK for Android. PlaygroundSamples lists the activity name after the sample name.
