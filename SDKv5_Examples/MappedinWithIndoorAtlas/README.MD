# Mappedin With Indoor Atlas

This project demonstrates the integration of [Indoor Atlas Android SDK](https://www.indooratlas.com/get-started/) with the [Mappedin Android SDK](https://developer.mappedin.com/android-sdk/latest/getting-started). Location information is provided by the Indoor Atlas indoor location system and passed to the Mappedin Android SDK. 

This project is featured in the blog post: [Find Your Way with Mappedin and Indoor Atlas](https://www.mappedin.com/blog/developers/use-cases/find-your-way-with-mappedin-and-indoor-atlas/)
